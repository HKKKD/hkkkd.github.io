##Hello World!

Hi! My name is Kaidi He. I'm from China and now study Computer Science in GWU major in security.

For me, speaking is the hardest part in English. Every time I talk to people in English I always suddenly don't know how to express myself and my heart is beating so fast like it would burst. However, academic writing is also what I wanna learn in this EAP6111 class which can help me finish assignments and papers perfectly in my future academic career.
