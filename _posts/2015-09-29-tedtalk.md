**This is an little summary of a [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/fei_fei_li_how_we_re_teaching_computers_to_understand_pictures).**

Today's technology is more advanced than ever, but to tell the computer to recognize picture is still a problem. Even though the computer right now can process so precise picture that even beyond human eyes' resolution, it stll can not beat a three-year-old child in describing a picture in front of it. Since the digital form of a picture is a two-dimensional array of numbers known as pixels, they do not carry any information about the content in this picture. First we have to teach the computer to see objects through millions labled pictures we gether from our ImageNet project and combine with algorithm. The algorithm tells the computer what is in the picture and the relationship between contents. With the combination of mechine learning and big data plus natural language process, we can teach computer to generate the description of a picture although it is not well performed. It can be used in all kinds of area such as medical surgery, space exploration, etc. Human are not the only one who can visualize the world and explore it since now.
