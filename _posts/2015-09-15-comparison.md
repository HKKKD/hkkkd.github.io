In general, these two articles are no doubt different from each other in several ways.  "Azuma 1997" is written by a CS Ph.D. and designed to be a guide to junior graduate students who would face the choice between academy and industry. In the article, the author stated a brief introduction about Ph.D. and why someone should have a Ph.D degree. He also gave some advice to those students who want to get a Ph.D. degree. And "Xia et al. 2008" is such a professional writing which was published at a research journal called _Management Science_. It focused on competitive supply marketplace and evaluated the situation that multiple suppliers offer a single non-differentiated product to multiple buyers. The evaluation of these two articles in three different criteria comes below.

###Audience

The auther of "Azuma 1997" stated in the article that "This document is aimed at junior C.S. graduate students". But it did not limit readers' area although it came from a CS Ph.D. because after that he said that "but these observations are probably broad enough to apply to graduate education in other technical fields". And for the more academic paper, "Xia et al. 2008", obviously is for experts and professionals who are focusing on study in economic area. For ordinary people, it is even hard to completely read this article without feeling annoying because of all those unknown technical terms and math equations.

###Argument

In "Azuma 1997", the author used a lot of personal opinion and experience to illustrate why get a Ph.D., several traits a good graduate student should acquired, etc. It is totally different in "Xia et al. 2008". Because an academic article should be objective. So it stated several mathematical formulas and figures to demonstrate author's idea. 

###Style

It is easy to find out that these two articles use different styles in writing sentence. There are many subjective statements such as "I wanted…", "I got…" and "I found…" in "Azuma 1997" which means they were come from author’s subjective idea. The paper style is quite different. It used a lot of “The study of…” and passive voice such as “…strategies have been studied…” which makes the article looks more scientific and reasonable. And also, there's no charts or figures in "Azuma 1997". But they appeared a lot in "Xia et al. 2008". 

There are also many differences in other criteria such as vocabulary, tone and scope. These two articles are typical examples of active and passive ways to spread authors’ idea. Finding out these differences is quite helpful to me in understanding different kinds of articles in future study.
