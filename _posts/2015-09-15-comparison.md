In general, these two articles are no doubt different from each other in several ways.  "Azuma 1997" is written by a CS Ph.D. and designed to be a guide to junior graduate students who would face the choice between academy and industry. In the article, the author stated a brief introduction about Ph.D. and why someone should have a Ph.D degree. He also gave some advice to those students who want to get a Ph.D. degree. And "Xia et al. 2008" is an absolutely professional writing which was posted on an research journal called _Management Science_. It focused on competitive supply marketplace and evaluated the situation that multiple suppliers offer a single non-differentiated product to multiple buyers. I’ll evaluate these two articles in three different criteria. Here comes below.

###Audience

As I mentioned before, it is obvious that "Azuma 1997" was written for junior graduate students. But it did not limit readers' area although it came from a CS Ph.D. And the academic paper, "Xia et al. 2008", obviously is for the expert and professionals that are focusing on study in economic area. For ordinary people, it is even hard to completely read this article without feeling annoying.

###Argument

In "Azuma 1997", the author used a lot of personal opinion and experience to illustrate why get a Ph.D., several traits a good graduate student should acquired, etc. It is totally different in "Xia et al. 2008". Because an academic should be objective. So it stated several mathematical formula and figures to demonstrate author's idea. 

###Style

It is easy to find out that these two articles use different styles in writing sentence. There are many “I wanted…”, “I got…” and “I found…” in “Azuma 1997” which means they were come from author’s subjective idea. The paper style is quite different. It used a lot of “The study of…” and passive voice such as “…strategies have been studied…” which makes the article looks more scientific and reasonable.  

There are also many differences in other criteria such as vocabulary, tone and scope. These two articles are typical examples of initiative and passive ways to spread authors’ idea. Finding out these differences is quite helpful to me in understanding variety kinds of articles in future study.
